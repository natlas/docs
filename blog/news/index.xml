&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re still getting started with the documentation, but we&amp;rsquo;ve gone from a blank github pages site to an automatically built docs site using &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.docsy.dev/">Docsy&lt;/a>. Some information that was spread haphazardly throughout the wiki has been consolidated into corresponding docs pages, and a Getting Started guide has been produced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are RSS feeds for both the &lt;a href="/docs/blog/news/index.xml">project news&lt;/a> as well as &lt;a href="/docs/blog/releases/index.xml">project releases&lt;/a>. If you know where to get a good RSS reader, give me a shout via Twitter. (R.I.P. Google Reader)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this development also brings the revival of the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/nVY8Stm">Natlas discord server&lt;/a>, where users and developers alike can convene to talk about ideas for Natlas, get support, and learn from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last but not least, The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NatlasTeam">Natlas Team&lt;/a> now has a Twitter account, which will be used to announce new blog posts, new tutorials, new projects, and new releases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
