# Natlas Documentation

## Cloning the Documentation

The following will give you a project that is set up and ready to use (don't forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won't pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site). The `hugo server` command builds and serves the site. If you just want to build the site, run `hugo` instead.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git
cd docsy-example
hugo server
```

The theme is included as a Git submodule:

```bash
▶ git submodule
 9030b750190321a5624515f66edc23c249a6f3ac themes/docsy (heads/master)
```

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS` (not needed for `hugo server`):

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the website locally

Once you've cloned the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```
