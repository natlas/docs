Maybe before getting started setting up your own server, you'd like to get a feel for what the tool looks like and what it can produce. The Natlas development team runs a [demo installation] that doesn't require authentication so that you can explore scan data at your leisure. This doesn't let you see the admin interface or the user interface, but it'll give you a feel for what kind of data can be collected and what it's like to use the platform.

[demo installation]: https://natlas.io
