We're still getting started with the documentation, but we've gone from a blank github pages site to an automatically built docs site using [Hugo] and [Docsy]. Some information that was spread haphazardly throughout the wiki has been consolidated into corresponding docs pages, and a Getting Started guide has been produced.

There are RSS feeds for both the [project news] as well as [project releases]. If you know where to get a good RSS reader, give me a shout via Twitter. (R.I.P. Google Reader)

With this development also brings the revival of the [Natlas discord server], where users and developers alike can convene to talk about ideas for Natlas, get support, and learn from each other.

Last but not least, The [Natlas Team] now has a Twitter account, which will be used to announce new blog posts, new tutorials, new projects, and new releases.
