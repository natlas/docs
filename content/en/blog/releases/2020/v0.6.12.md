### Added

- (Agent) Better telemetry indicators for exceptions with Sentry ([#445](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/pull/445))

### Fixed

- (Server) Scope import via cli now works as expected ([#436](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/436))
- (Server) Scope export now works even when scope items have tags ([#426](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/426))
- (Server) Errors are now reported as json when json is expected ([#442](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/pull/442))
- (Server) Searching with a bad search query now returns a 400 Bad Request page instead of an Internal Server Error, and links to [our search documentation](https://docs.natlas.io/docs/tasks/searching-natlas/) ([#444](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/444))
- (Server) Accessing `/host/<an.invalid.ip>` no longer throws an exception but rather throws a 404 as expected. ([#449](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/449))
- (Server) No longer throw an exception when `xml_data` is missing from a submission ([#441](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/441))
