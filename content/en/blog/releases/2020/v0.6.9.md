## Github

[Github Release](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/releases/tag/v0.6.9)

### Added

- Search can now be augmented with `&format=json` to return search results in json format.

### Changed

- Random button now replaces the url with the current host it finds. This means you can no longer spam f5 to load a new random host, however you can now go back in history to previous random findings.

### Security

- Updated Pillow dependency to address CVE-2020-5313 and CVE-2019-19911.
