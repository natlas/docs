* Server - Added `tags` example to search help modal ([#149](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/149))

### Changed

* Server - Automatically attempt to reconnect to elasticsearch on the next request if our last attempt failed and it's been more than 60 seconds. ([#154](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/154))
* Server/Agent - `scan_id` field increased from 10 characters in length to 16 characters. ([#66](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/66))

### Fixed

* Server - Fixed bug in scan manager where updating the networks in range to scan caused unexpected scan targets. ([#150](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/150))
