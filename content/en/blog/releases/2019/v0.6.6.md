  Agent Improvements, Screenshot Browser, & More

### Known Bugs

- 2019-10-16 - The agent doesn't automatically create it's logs folder, resulting in a failure. `mkdir logs` in the `natlas-agent` directory to fix this. ([#181](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/181)). This has been hotpatched into the 0.6.6 release tarball below.
- 2019-10-16 - When nmap times out (typically meaning the process took too long to end after the --host-timeout value expired), the agent thread will try to submit results and check for an invalid key. This is noted by [#184](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/184) but is not included in the attached tarball.

### Added

- Screenshot Browser ([#173](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/173))
- Administrative settings:
  - Optionally use local subresources instead of CDN subresources (#[105](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/105))
  - Optionally add a custom brand field to navigation to more easily identify the natlas instance you're viewing ([#106](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/106))
- Store structured SSL certificate data for any port that we've identified an ssl-cert for ([#146](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/146))

### Changed

- Agent logging is done via an app logger now with timestamps and to a file. ([#170](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/170))
- Agent relies on nmap capabilities being set instead of running as root. ([#123](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/123)) (Thanks droberson!)
- Agent refactoring to improve maintainability

### Fixed

- Handle NmapParserException when malformed xml files are encountered ([#169](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/169))
- Improve randomness of `/random/` route by selecting a rand int each time instead of seeding with timestamp. ([#178](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/178))
