### Added

- Administrators can now configure process timeout values for web and vnc screenshot agent capabilities. ([#186](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/186))
- Users may now choose to search historical results by including `includeHistory=1` in the query parameters. ([#110](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/110))
- Agents can now optionally save data that failed to upload to the server via the `NATLAS_SAVE_FAILS` environment variable. ([#129](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/129))
- Importing scope, either via the web interface or via the `./add-scope.py` script, now supports importing scope items with tags. Each imported line can have a comma separated list of tags. Tags will be created if they don't already exist. ([#142](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/142))

### Changed

- Screenshots are stored in deterministic location based purely on their file hash, instead of `timestamp/<hash>.ext`. ([#182](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/182))
- Agents will now get work definitions from the server even when scanning targets from a file or the command line. ([#179](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/179))

### Fixed

- Agent now correctly makes sure that it's logs folder exists before trying to use it. ([#181](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/181))
- Agent checks for `timed_out` before it checks for `is_up` ([#184](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/184))
- Handle exceptions when export requests are made for non-existing data ([#191](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/191)
- Removed unexpected search export button when no search results [#193](https://github.com/natlas/natlas/issues/193)
